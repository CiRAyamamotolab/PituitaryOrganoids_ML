This repository aims to construct a machine learning-based prediction model of organoid formation efficiency from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Here, codes to construct a prediction model for hiPSC-derived hypothalamus-pituitary organoid (Ozone C. et al., Nature communications 2016;7:10351) and constructed models (.h5) are presented. 

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models were built using TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org/). For the model constructions, phase-constrast images of organoids on days 3, 9, 15, 21, and 27 were used for the prediction of LHX3+ pituitary progenitor cell differentiation on day 39. 

For the purpose of visualization of important features for decision making of the models, Graddient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used.
